I build this CRUD application in React JS, CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. We can see in the video that the data is coming from a DB.json file that I created with NodeJS Server and then I fetch the data and map it to a table. If we see in the navigation that there is a button "AddUser" if we click this button we can add new data to the table and there are three buttons in the table "View" "Edit" and "Delete", if we Click on View. All the details of this data will be visible on the button and we can edit the data by clicking the Edit button and delete the data with the help of the Delete button.
